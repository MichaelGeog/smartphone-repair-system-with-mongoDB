# Smartphone Repair Management System

This project is a **full-stack Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB web application** for managing smartphone repair tickets.  
It allows users to create, view, and manage repair tickets with details such as customer information, device type, issue type, and pricing.  

The app uses:
- **Express.js** for building REST APIs and serving pages
- **MongoDB Atlas** for database storage
- **EJS** for server-side rendering of the frontend
- **CSS** for a clean and responsive UI

## âœ¨ Features

- **Brands Management**: Add, update, view, and delete smartphone brands (Apple, Samsung, Google, etc.).  
- **Devices Management**: Manage devices by brand (e.g., iPhone models for Apple).  
- **Issues Management**: Define repair issues (screen cracked, battery replacement, charging port, etc.) with pricing.  
- **Tickets Management**: Create and manage repair tickets with customer details, device, issue, and price.  
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Ticket price is automatically resolved from the issue database.  
- **Frontend UI**: EJS-based form and table for creating and viewing tickets.  
- **REST API**: Full CRUD API for brands, devices, issues, and tickets.  
- **MongoDB Integration**: All data is persisted in MongoDB Atlas (cloud database).  
- **Middleware**: Custom logger and centralized error handling.
